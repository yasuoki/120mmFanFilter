# Parts Printing
- All parts do not require support.
- Winglets have a narrow bottom area and are easily peeled off during printing.  
If the bed has weak adhesion, print WingletA_S.stl and WingetB_S.stl with built-in anti-tip supports.

- Winglet B has a notch for fan wiring.  
Depending on the wiring path, usually three A's and one B are printed.
